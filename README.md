# Clinic-DBMS
Managing patient records, appointments, and billing efficiently is critical for healthcare clinics. I developed a structured, secure, and automated DBMS for a clinic database, ensuring seamless data handling across multiple entities.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

âœ… Designed and implemented a relational database (ClinicDB) with five key tables: Patients, Doctors, Appointments, Billing, and Medical Records 

âœ… Developed SQL queries & triggers to automate appointment status updates and billing transactions 

âœ… Structured user access control, granting specific privileges for doctors, receptionists, and patients

ðŸ”¹ Key Database Features & Insights

âœ… Appointment Automation â€“ A trigger updates appointment status to "Completed" once a medical record is entered

âœ… Billing Optimization â€“ A trigger automatically updates billing status to "Paid" when a transaction is processed 

âœ… Patient & Medical Record Management â€“ Doctors can update treatment plans and prescriptions, while patients have secure access to their records 

âœ… Role-Based Access Control â€“ Admins manage users, doctors update records, receptionists schedule appointments, and patients view personal information

This centralized healthcare DBMS reduces manual workload, improves data accuracy, and ensures secure patient record management. Healthcare facilities can benefit from automated processes, reducing operational inefficiencies while enhancing patient care.
